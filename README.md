# Flutter_Login_Page
This is a simple login page made using Flutter. The app has email and password fields with basic validation. If the user enters a wrong email format or a password with less than 6 characters, it shows an error message. After a successful login, the user is taken to a small dashboard page. The UI is clean, minimal, and easy to understand.
